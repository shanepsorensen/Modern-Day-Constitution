# The Modern day Constitution

## Contribution Guide

Welcome! To keep things civil, I am setting some ground rules so that everyone can participate.

The rules are pretty simple, we are rewording the text of the Constitution to not only update the English, but to also better flush-out details and intentions. Keep in mind, that this entire document should mesh perfectly with current law, rights, and liberties.

This project was created out the spirit of the "American Dream" and the freedoms that we, as the United States, find innately true. There are no "political parties." There is no "us" or "them." There is just the United States, and it's people.


## Small Changes

Small changes, which include re-wording or paragraph rewriting, should have an Issue opened up. The title should include a brief description of what you want to change and where. Please make sure you describe in the comment, what you want changed, what it should be changed to (if applicable), and *why*. The biggest emphasis is *why*, because everything here needs to have a reason, we can't just change the law to change the law.


## Major Changes

Major changes, such as adding and subtracting sections or rewriting entire articles, should have merge requests opened up. Use the comment to indicate why you believe your merge should be included, and discuss with others. Please don't debate, leave that to the politicians who get paid to do that. We're here to do their job. Please also make sure that your merge request also goes to the proper branch.


## Branch Structure

To keep the project clean and well maintained, the branch structure will have a funnel shape.

| Branch Name | Function / Description |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| working-iteration | Initial import of all ideas into text; Direct outside merge requests here |
| english-check | For all ideas agreed upon; Verification of basic English and grammar |
| final-vote | Everyone will have one last chance to dispute all text |
| master | The final text; This would be what is written into law |
