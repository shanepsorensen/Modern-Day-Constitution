## But How?

So you might be wondering: "even if a new Constitution is drafted, how would it be implemented?" I wondered that too, but the answer is in another important document in US history: The Declaration of Independence.
> [That] to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, â€” That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

This passage was one of the foundation blocks that justified the colonies creating their own government, and it is the foundation block of this project. In my eyes, the government of today is quickly becoming destructive of our rights and freedoms, and as such, we should "course correct" to make our lives and futures better.
